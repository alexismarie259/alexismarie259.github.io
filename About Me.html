<p> My friends and family mean the world to me. I have so many friends from home but I have made so many new at school as well. I've met my closest friends from sports, classes, and just from everyday casualties.I'm extremely grateful to be so close to my family, but I also consider my friends as family. There is no one I get along with more than I do my sister, which is weird to say because many people do no get along that well with their siblings. I am blessed to have the type of people I do in my life.
